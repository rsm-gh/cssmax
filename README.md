# CSSMAX

`cssmax` is a Python module to decompress (un-minify or unpack) CSS code.

**Warning: This is not a script to beautify CSS.** Before decompressing, it will compress by using `cssmin` 
and all the comments will go away.

**History**

This script was originally named [css_decompressor](https://sourceforge.net/p/bluefish/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/bluefish/data/css_decompressor) created for [Blue Fish](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/index.html) under the GPL3 license.

In 2024, it had a micro-maintenance update, and it was re-licensed under the MIT license.

In 2025, it was renamed to `cssmax`.
